## Introduction

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

> **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**  
> **Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.**

This principle helps to reduce the coupling between different parts of a system, making it more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain.

## Why Use Dependency Inversion?

- **Improves code maintainability:** Changes in low-level modules do not affect high-level modules directly.
- **Enhances flexibility:** You can swap out implementations without changing the dependent code.
- **Facilitates testing:** Easier to mock dependencies and write unit tests.
- **Promotes reusable and scalable design.**

## Key Concepts

- **High-level modules:** Components that contain complex logic or business rules.
- **Low-level modules:** Components that handle detailed operations such as database access, file I/O, or network communication.
- **Abstractions:** Interfaces or abstract classes that define contracts without implementation details.
